  A user will be taken to the <code>/logged_in</code> page. <br>
  From here a user can edit any of the given flowcharts by clicking on the edit button. This takes them to the <code>/flowchart</code> page. <br>
  Currently, you can choose the <code>taken</code>, <code>in progress</code>, or <code>future</code> buttons. Once you select a button, you can click all classes associated with this status. <br>
